## üöÄ Usage Flow

1. **Rust Client Upload**  
   Rust application uploads image via `POST /api/screenshot`.

2. **AI-Powered Processing**  
   Screenshot is processed using **Pixtral** for insights and **LangChain4j** for structured data extraction.

3. **Data Persistence**  
   Results are saved in MongoDB under the `screenshotlog` collection.

4. **Stream Back Processed Data**  
   Clients can stream the processed result via `/api/screenshot/stream/{id}`.

5. **Generate Analytics**  
   Reports can be queried via the `/api/screenshot/reports` endpoint with rich filtering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running

1. **MongoDB Configuration**  
   Set connection details in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/screenshotdb
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use Maven or Gradle to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys**  
   Set API keys and secrets for **Pixtral** and **LangChain4j** either in:
   - `application.properties`
   - Environment variables

4. **Start the Application**  
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Client Integration (Rust)**  
   Rust application makes a `POST` request to:
   ```
   /api/screenshot
   ```
   with multipart form data including the image.
